# Burble
A comic-book inspired chat restyle for Foundry VTT.

Burble's main goal is just make chat a bit more characterful and aesthetically pleasing. However, it also has the secondary goal of making chat easier to process at a glance, by de-emphasising the frames around messages and making conversational messages more distinct from system messages like rolls.
